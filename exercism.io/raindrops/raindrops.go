/*
	Package raindrops implements string convertion from int to string

	The rules of raindrops are that if a given number:

    has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
    has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
    has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.

    does not have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.
